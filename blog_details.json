        "blog": "According to Hindu legend, the god Vishnu sat in meditation at this place. During his meditation, Vishnu was unaware of cold weather. Lakshmi, his consort, protected him in the form of the Badri tree (jujube or Indian date, called 'ber' in Hindi). Pleased by the devotion of Lakshmi, Vishnu named the place Badrika Ashrama. According to Atkinson (1979), the place used to be a jujube forest, which is not found there today. Vishnu in the form of Badrinatha is depicted in the temple sitting in the padmasana posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by sage Narada, who saw Vishnu's consort, Lakshmi, massaging his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for a long time in padmasana.[2][11] The Vishnu Purana narrates another version of the origins of Badrinath. According to the tradition, Yama had two sons, Nara, and Narayana\u2014both of which are modern names of Himalayan mountains. They chose the place to spread their religion and each of them wed the spacious valleys in the Himalayas. Searching for an ideal place to set up a hermitage, they came across the other four Badris of the Pancha Badri, namely Bridha Badri, Yoga Badri, Dhyana Badri and Bhavisha Badri. They finally found the hot and cold spring behind the Alaknanda River and named it 'Badri Vishala.'",

        "blog": "Khaliya top is a snow-covered alpine meadow high up in the Kumaon Himalayas, around 12 km from Munsiyari in the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand. The trek from Munsiyari to Khaliya Top can be completed in a day but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better to plan it as an extended and relaxed weekend break. The actual climb to the Khaliya Top summit begins from Balati Bend, from where the peak is around 6 km. While termed as an easy to moderate trek, there are some steep climbs on this route as well. A hidden gem, the trek to this mountain top is sought-after only by those who love to walk through pristine snow even in summer, and want an off-beat experience. The trek route meanders through dense forests, and offers sightings of exotic mountain animals and birds. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most well-known for the outstanding views of surrounding mountain peaks, including Panchachuli, Nandadevi, Hardeol, Nandakot and Rajrambha. If you can be at the summit during sunset, the mesmerising view of the setting sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hues painting the peaks in shades of fire will make the memory of a lifetime. Some experienced trekkers start early from Balati Bend to reach the summit for a sunrise show of nature. If you have some time in hand, after you have reached the summit, trek ahead for about one kilometre to Zero Point for a panoramic 360-degree view of the surrounding mountains. The sight of the undulating peaks enveloped in cloud is what pulls most trekkers back here again and again! In winter, between late-December to February, you can also enjoy skiing at Khaliya bugyal, an adjacent high altitude pasture blanketed with thick snow year-round. Ski equipment and training is available here during season. In summer, you can try paragliding at Khaliya Top. The trek is a must-try and even beginners can attempt it but physical fitness is necessary, and do not plan it without an expert guide. During winter, the trek can become challenging if you are not used to high-altitude snowy terrains. Carry adequate winter clothing even in summer. KMVN has a guest house near the summit and offers a comfortable break and you can book here,",

        "blog": "Roopkund (locally known as Mystery Lake or Skeleton Lake)[1] is a high altitude glacial lake in the Uttarakhand state of India. It lies in the lap of Trishul massif. Located in the Himalayas, the area around the lake is uninhabited and is roughly at an altitude of 5,020 metres (16,470 ft),[1] surrounded by rock-strewn glaciers and snow-clad mountains. Roopkund is a popular trekking destination.[2] The size of the lake varies substantially, but it is seldom more than 40 metres in diameter (1000 to 1500 square metres in area), and is frozen in the winter.[3]\r\n\r\nWith a depth of about three metres, Roopkund is widely known for the hundreds of ancient human skeletons found at the edge of the lake.[4] The human skeletal remains are visible at its bottom when the snow melts.[5] Initial investigations led some to believe they were the remains of a semi-legendary event when a single group was killed in a sudden and violent hailstorm in the 9th century,[6] but scientific research has subsequently shown that the remains belong to three distinct groups who died in two independent events; around 800 CE and 1800 CE respectively.[7] Because of the human remains, the lake has been called \"Skeleton Lake\" in recent times.",

According to popular beliefs, when Pandavas were seeking penance for their sins of killing their blood, they wanted to please Lord Shiva.\n\nHowever, God had other plans, and disguised as a bull, he appeared on the earth and started to roam around Garhwal Himalayas (hill stations near Delhi). When Pandavas found that the bull was actually Lord Shiva, the Deity disappeared into the ground. Bhima, one of the five brothers, could only get the hold of the hump of the bull.\n\nHence, Lord Shiva reappeared in the form of the hump in Kedarnath, face in Rudranath, hair in Kalpeshwar, arms in Tungnath and stomach in Madhyamaheshwar. Pandavas built temples in all these five places to repent for their sins",

        "blog": "Kumbh Mela, also called Kumbha Mela, in Hinduism, religious festival that is celebrated four times over the course of 12 years, the site of the observance rotating between four pilgrimage places on four sacred rivers\u2014at Haridwar on the Ganges River, at Ujjain on the Shipra, at Nashik on the Godavari, and at Prayag (modern Prayagraj) at the confluence of the Ganges, the Jamuna, and the mythical Sarasvati. Each site\u2019s celebration is based on a distinct set of astrological positions of the Sun, the Moon, and Jupiter, the holiest time occurring at the exact moment when these positions are fully occupied. The Kumbh Mela at Prayag, in particular, attracts millions of pilgrims. In addition, a Great Kumbh Mela festival is held every 144 years at Prayag, most recently in 2001. The Kumbh Mela lasts several weeks and is one of the largest festivals in the world, attracting more than 200 million people in 2019, including 50 million on the festival\u2019s most auspicious day.\r\n\r\nAttendees at the Kumbh Mela come from all sections of Hindu religious life, ranging from sadhus (holy men), who remain naked year-round or practice the most severe physical discipline, to hermits, who leave their isolation only for these pilgrimages, and even to silk-clad teachers using the latest technology. The religious organizations represented range from social welfare societies to political lobbyists. Vast crowds of disciples, friends, and spectators join the individual ascetics and organizations. The naga akhadas, militant ascetic orders whose members formerly made their livings as mercenary soldiers and traders, often claim the holiest spots at each Kumbh Mela\u2019s most propitious moment. Although the Indian government now enforces an established bathing order, history records bloody disputes between groups vying for precedence.\r\n\r\nTradition ascribes the Kumbh Mela\u2019s origin to the 8th-century philosopher Shankara, who instituted regular gatherings of learned ascetics for discussion and debate. The founding myth of the Kumbh Mela\u2014attributed to the Puranas (collections of myth and legend)\u2014recounts how the gods and demons fought over the pot (kumbha) of amrita, the elixir of immortality produced by their joint churning of the milky ocean. During the struggle, drops of the elixir fell on the Kumbh Mela\u2019s four earthly sites, and the rivers are believed to turn back into that primordial nectar at the climactic moment of each, giving pilgrims the chance to bathe in the essence of purity, auspiciousness, and immortality. The term Kumbh comes from this mythic pot of elixir, but it is also the Hindi name for Aquarius, the sign of the zodiac in which Jupiter resides during the Haridwar Mela.",
